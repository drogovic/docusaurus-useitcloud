There is two ways to onboard an AWS account into UIC platform: 
- IAM User with Access Key and Secret Key
- Role based Access (Cross-account trust relationship)

## Creating a Policy
Log in to your AWS account, enter your user ID, root/ admin password.
Once entered, the home page will be displayed, from the **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service, select **Policies** on the left menu.

- Click the Create Policy button, and then paste the json below:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:GetPolicy",
        "iam:GetRole",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreatePolicy",
        "organizations:ListParents",
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "sts:AssumeRole",
        "ce:GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation",
        "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
        "ce:GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation",
        "ce:GetReservationUtilization",
        "ce:GetDimensionValues",
        "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails",
        "ce:GetAnomalySubscriptions",
        "ce:GetReservationCoverage",
        "ce:GetAnomalyMonitors",
        "ce:GetUsageForecast",
        "ce:DescribeCostCategoryDefinition",
        "ce:GetSavingsPlansCoverage",
        "ce:GetRightsizingRecommendation",
        "ce:GetCostAndUsageWithResources",
        "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization",
        "ce:GetAnomalies",
        "ce:ListCostCategoryDefinitions",
        "ce:GetCostForecast",
        "ce:GetTags",
        "budgets:*",
        "pricing:*",
        "sns:*",
        "ec2:*",
        "gamelift:DescribeEC2InstanceLimits",

        "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Name this policy **UICPolicy**

## Billing Data Access
The billing data access is optional if you do not need to analyze your billing AWS data.

###  Creating a Policy
To display AWS billing on the UIC platform, we need to create two policies called **"uicBillingViewAccess"** and **"FinOpsAccess"**.
- Click the Create Policy button, and then paste the json below:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "aws-portal:ViewAccount",
                "aws-portal:ViewBilling",
                "aws-portal:ViewPaymentMethods",
                "aws-portal:ViewUsage"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

### Enable access to billing data 
You can grant IAM users and federated users with roles, the permission to access billing information. This includes access to **account settings, Payment Methods** and **Report**. You define users and authorized roles to view billing information by creating IAM policies.

Connect to AWS website, enter your user login (having the administration right of your account) and your password. The home page appears. In the top right tab, click on **My Account**. See picture below

:::note
A warning indicates that this is the only time you will be able to view or download the secret access key. You will not be able to retrieve it later (but you can create new access keys at any time).
:::
- Choose Show secret access key to view or copy the access key ID and the Secret access key.

## Role base Access
Securely connect your AWS account with UIC. Create an IAM role, establish trust relationship and enable cross account access between your AWS account and UIC's AWS account by following the below mentioned steps.

### Create role
Log in to the **AWS Management Console** and open the *AWS IAM console*. In the navigation pane click on ***Roles*** and then choose Create role.

![Image](/img_UIC_Provider_Cred_Settings/awsimage031.png#bordered)
 
Establish Trust
- Select **Another AWS account** as the type of trusted entity.
- Type in UIC's AWS account ID  **760211127657** in the **Account ID** field.

![Image](/img_UIC_Provider_Cred_Settings/awsimage032.png#bordered)

- Check the ***Require external ID*** field option
- Type in the **External ID** (The External ID is displayed in the Integrate AWS Account form) and click on ***Next: Permissions***
 
- Make sure the **"Require MFA"** option remains unchecked and click on **"Next: Permissions"**

![Image](/img_UIC_Provider_Cred_Settings/awsimage033.png#bordered)

### Attach Permissions
In the **Attach permissions** policy section, search for the newly created policy **UICpolicy** and FinOpsAccess (see section 3.2 below), select it and click on **"Next:Review"**.

### Review
- Type a unique name in the **Role name** field for exemple **TrustUICRole**.
- Review the information configured - Trusted entities and policies, if everything is in order, click on **Create Role**. Once done, a **Role ARN** will be created for the cross-account IAM role you created.
Now you have the required attributes to setup your AWS account under UIC platform which are:
- trusted_account_id: your AWS account id
- trusted_role: **TrustUICRole**
- trusted_external_id: **20203061236**

## Onboarding to UIC platform

## Inventory mode
For Inventory mode, we need the following actions.

### Creating a Policy
For inventory ReadOnlyAccess policy is required. Log in to your  AWS account, enter your user ID, root/ admin password.
Once entered, the home page will be displayed, from the **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service, select **Policies** on the left menu.

![Image](/img_UIC_Provider_Cred_Settings/awsimage038.jpg#bordered)

- Search the ReadOnlyAccess if it is available under your IAM policies.
- You can modify it, or create your own policy, if you are skilled in using the default ReadOnlyAccess policy.
